INX Future Inc – HR Performance Analytics Project
Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing employee performance data for INX Future Inc to understand what differentiates Low, Medium, and High performers.
The objective is to help management identify patterns related to training, promotions, job involvement, and satisfaction, so they can take data-driven actions to improve overall performance and retention.

Business Problem

Management wanted answers to questions like:

What factors lead to low or high employee performance?

Which departments have more low performers?

Does training or promotion frequency impact performance?

Are high performers leaving the company?

This project was built to answer these questions using data.

Tools Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data cleaning and feature engineering

MySQL – Storing and querying cleaned data

Power BI – Interactive dashboard and visual analysis

Project Approach (Step by Step)

Loaded and explored the HR dataset using Python.

Cleaned the data and converted key fields (such as Attrition).

Created a new performance category (Low / Medium / High) from performance ratings.

Stored the cleaned data in MySQL for structured analysis.

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with KPIs, charts, and slicers.

Key Insights

Sales and HR departments showed a higher proportion of low performers.

Employees with higher job involvement tend to perform better.

Regular training (around 3–5 sessions per year) is associated with higher performance.

Employees promoted recently perform better than those waiting many years for promotion.

Attrition is higher among low and medium performers, but losing high performers is a major risk.

Dashboard Highlights

The Power BI dashboard includes:

Performance distribution (Low / Medium / High)

Performance by department and job involvement

Training and promotion impact on performance

Attrition analysis by performance category

Interactive slicers for department, job role, age group, and attrition

Outcome

This project helps HR and management teams understand why employees perform the way they do and where to focus efforts such as training, engagement, and promotion planning to improve performance and retention.
